Webpage containing tutorials/visualizations for various concepts in CS-related classes

Ideas:
- domino visualization/explanation of proof by induction? I know a lot of people including myself had a hard time understanding the logical structure of proof by induction--for me it was realizing that the induction hypothesis and induction step (assume n, show n+1) by itself is NOT meant to prove that the original claim works for all n. after all, how can you prove the claim for all n by assuming n? but then it clicked for me when someone explained that we are just showing that n => n+1.

- sieve of eratosthenes visualization (not sure how helpful this would be, because it seems pretty intuitive already)

- stable matching step-by-step demo
