    Let 
    be distinct numbers relatively prime, for any integers 
    there’s an integer  such that

    
    All the solutions of this system are congruent modulo 

    nrich’s article on the chinese remainder illustrates the system of equations with a coordinate system in -dimensions, basically a number can represent a point in the coordinate system defined by the equation system and the point itself is a sum of unit vectors scaled by some amount

    Example: Represent the number  in the coordinate system defined by the integers that belong to the set of integers ,  and  ( has  elements which are all the number in the range )

    The statement above is equivalent to

    
    We can see that  is represented by the point 

    What we want to do is the opposite, that is find the number whose representation in the coordinate system defined by the integers that belong to the set of integers 
    results in the point 

    What we can do is express these conditions as a sum of scaled unit vectors that belong to each of axis of the coordinate systems, this means that a point 
    can be represented as

    If we represent each point as 

    
    Let’s take the first term of the sum, 
    is a number which must fulfill the following equivalences for each axis of the coordinate system

    
    From the system of equations above we can see that 
    which means that 
    is some multiple of the multiplication i.e. 

    Given the fact that 
    is relatively prime to 
    the product has a modular multiplicative inverse which can be found using the extended euclidean algorithm, in fact we have to solve  of this equations each having the form

    
    Finally we have to plug these values into the equation
